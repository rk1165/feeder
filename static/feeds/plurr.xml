Perl
v.5.38,0,
the first bits of Corinna have been added to the Perl core. For
those who have not been following along, Corinna is a project to add
a new object system to the Perl core. Note that itâs not taking
anything away from Perl; itâs adding a core object system for better
memory consumption, performance, and elegance.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.800916</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">yCW2FKbPmUoLhJPamEzuRlTrXNIkHXuDXQuhbmenofk=</guid></item><item><title>An elegant new orchid is found hiding in plain sight</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/07/06.html#an-elegant-new-orchid-is-found-hiding-in-plain-sight</link><description>It is extremely rare for a new plant species to be discovered in

complex. It doesnât fall into neat rows and columns like numerical
data does. As a side project, Iâm in the process of developing my
own personal AI assistant. The objective is to use the data within
my notes and documents to answer my questions. The important benefit
is all data processing will occure locally on my computer, ensuring
that no documents are uploaded to the cloud, and my documents will
remain private.
To handle such unstructured data, Iâve found the unstructured
Python library to be extremely useful. Itâs a flexible tool that
works with various document formats, including Markdown, , XML, and
HTML documents.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.800929</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">17cxbSPxDXnlW83CFgrwOrYL2psVMaj9RLV-7dkqzos=</guid></item><item><title>Image Upscaling Using Neural Networks</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/07/06.html#image-upscaling-using-neural-networks</link><description>Do you remember those classic scenes from CSI TV series?

crate to enable better
internal composition, and to make it easier to add optimizations
while maintaining correctness. In the course of this rewrite I
created a new crate,
regex-automata,
which exposes much of the regex crate internals as their own APIs
for others to use. To my knowledge, this is the first regex library
to expose its internals to the degree done in regex-automata as a
separately versioned library.
This blog post discusses the problems that led to the rewrite, how
the rewrite solved them and a guided tour of regex-automataâs API.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.800942</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">BKlCvBydoQqkL7XHZWdPxCwd_wVYnVKDNfTh6XYc8oo=</guid></item><item><title>Mastering Intermediate Linux Commands for Server Management</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/07/05.html#mastering-intermediate-linux-commands-for-server-management</link><description>As a sysadmin, you often come across complex tasks that require more

which is a guide to the proportion of tests to write along the
isolation / integration spectrum. Thereâs an eternal debate about
what the best proportion should be at each level, but interestingly
itâs always presented with the assumption that test cases are
hand-written. We should also think about test generation as a
dimension, and if I were to draw a pyramid about it Iâd place
generated tests on the bottom and hand-written scenarios on top,
i.e. most tests should be generated.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.800961</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0qiJUNB6yH-vOreH7xIDK8Zt3s8unIhe4jaXaSWkD_g=</guid></item><item><title>Two Ways to Turbo-Charge tox</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/07/04.html#two-ways-to-turbo-charge-tox</link><description>The traditional way to speed up tox runs is running it as tox run-parallel (nÃ©e tox --parallel or just tox -p). And while
itâs currently broken in tox

truly included), itâs a great feature that Nox is sorely lacking.
But there are more ways, and Iâd like to share two of them with
you. Both methods donât make much difference in CIs like GitHub
Actions (just like tox run-parallel, mind you!), but they can do
wonders for your local development. Which is where I have the least

seamless alternative to threads. Just sprinkle these keywords
through your code and get concurrency that scales better! I think
this is very misleading. An async fn is a different thing from a
normal Rust fn, and you need to think about different things to
write correct code in each case.
This post presents a different way of looking at async that I
think is more useful, and less likely to lead to
cancellation-related bugs.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.800990</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">U9Oe4XYmDf4bW71jKFTIh93clp29Le3jZIptJMmQ8kc=</guid></item><item><title>Joins 13 Ways</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/07/03.html#joins-13-ways</link><description>Relational (inner) joins are really common in the world of

call from the Chesapeake police. Thirty feet deep in the murky
waters of Virginia's Elizabeth River, a scuba diver's body is
discovered near the Inactive Naval Shipyard.As the police begin
searching for clues, the wallet of investigative reporter Ted
Eddings is found.
Unnerved by the possible identity of the victim, Scarpetta orders
the crime scene roped off and left alone until she arrives. What was
he doing there, searching for Civil War relics as the officer
suggested, or was there a bigger story? As she rifles through the
multitude of clues, a second murder hits much closer to home. This
new development puts Scarpetta and her colleagues hot on the trail
of a military conspiracy.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801019</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">2p9eVLrEnT592Nr7EH-9VyrvhyZWPKrjXXB07x0SM6E=</guid></item><item><title>From Potter's Field: Good</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/07/01.html#from-potter's-field:-good</link><description /><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801025</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">MbstYVKCjqxZ57aNiB0MdXfm28Wvnk_uJj4g_TIRRH8=</guid></item><item><title>My git worfklow</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/07/01.html#my-git-worfklow</link><description>Every now and then, at work, I find myself discussing git worfklows,

panes, each running different applications or instances of the same
application. When we make changes to a configuration file, such as
~/.vimrc for Vim or ~/.aliases for our shell, we need to
manually reload that configuration in each relevant instance. This
can be a time-consuming process, especially when working with a
large number of panes. But also, let's be wizards and automate this
process!
In this post, we'll explore a simple automation that can save you a
lot of time and effort. We'll focus on a specific use case â
reloading a .vimrc file across all Vim instances in tmux panes â
but the pattern can be applied to a variety of scenarios.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801114</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">VjfqKMn-FEO3SMQ8ZHUxgGvya_UeQop0pMXWdHSLO6c=</guid></item><item><title>NixOS and my Descent into Insanity</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/06/29.html#nixos-and-my-descent-into-insanity</link><description>As I tend to do, I picked a topic to write about that is much larger

Definitely not, just like anything else in software. At the same

code to native machine code without any runtime overhead. Typical
speedups over Python are on the order of 100x or more, on a single
thread. Codon supports native multithreading which can lead to
speedups many times higher still.
The Codon framework is fully modular and extensible, allowing for
the seamless integration of new modules, compiler optimizations,
domain-specific languages and so on. We actively develop Codon
extensions for a number of domains such as bioinformatics and
quantitative finance.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801184</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">q3xiiHVqsY9P6Ig5-GBfFvrgCj7AiYMt86al2oE_m98=</guid></item><item><title>Advanced macOS Command-Line Tools</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/06/27.html#advanced-macos-command-line-tools</link><description>macOS is fortunate to have access to the huge arsenal of standard

Central Park. There are no signs of struggle. When Dr. Kay Scarpetta
and her colleagues Benton Wesley and Pete Marino arrive on the
scene, they instantly recognize the signature of serial killer
Temple Brooks Gault. Scarpetta, on assignment with the FBI, visits
the New York City morgue on Christmas morning, where she must use
her forensic expertise to give a name to the namelessâa difficult
task. But as she sorts through conflicting forensic clues, Gault
claims his next victim. He has infiltrated the FBIâs top secret
artificial-intelligence system developed by Scarpettaâs niece, and
sends taunting messages as his butchery continues, moving
terrifyingly closer to Scarpetta herself.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801195</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">Rvv6Qc-t0Ddf5u8lcf5Gyie0iReEbRJEKeNL_bbPGtE=</guid></item><item><title>An Introduction to Parser Combinators</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/06/26.html#an-introduction-to-parser-combinators</link><description>If youâve ever had to write a parser before, you know that creating
parsers can be a tedious and complicated process. The good news is
that it doesnât have to be this way. In this post, Iâm going to
introduce parser combinators - a technique for building parsers

the one that has endured the test of time the most. Introduced by
Vincent Driessen in
2010,
its fundamental idea is that you should isolate your work into
different types of git branches.
Other branching strategies, such as the centralized workflow (for
those teams that come from SVN), and the forking workflow (for
open-source projects) exist. Git, as a version control system, only
details basic branching operations, and it remains controversial as
to which approach is the best. Beyond those basic branching
operations, it's a matter of opinion.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801207</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">vnJQPlz-gdMScbt03O9EwYOZ7jBoRGLngWEuBCqCvDw=</guid></item><item><title>Raku is pretty damn Cool</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/06/25.html#raku-is-pretty-damn-cool</link><description>The first time, I've heard of Raku was

FOR
[KEY] UPDATE|SHARE. Itâs used in the same place as NOWAIT and, like
NOWAIT, affects behaviour when the tuple is locked by another
transaction.
The main utility of SKIP LOCKED is for building simple, reliable and
efficient concurrent work queues.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801218</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">cRJoyvb_Sw_PfnVRdAG-wyAuLzqHkmW1j2UwNFXeeeM=</guid></item><item><title>Completely purge files from a git repository</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/06/25.html#completely-purge-files-from-a-git-repository</link><description>I have occasionally ended up with files I did not want in my git
repositories. These can both take up a lot of space, and contain
sensitive data that we just want to remove (such as MySQL dumps,
deploy keys etc).
Git keeps a history of all files, so just deleting the file doesnât
âmake it go awayâ. The only way to completely remove the file is to
scan through all history, removing all references to (and history
of) those files, and finally pruning the git repo (physically
removing references to what we just deleted). Finally you have to
force-push the repo changes back to the remote, overwriting the
remote.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801224</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">-DpH-NFTYcSkvzdKr--2-IjR7oUbZpYF54C8Syp_SoU=</guid></item><item><title>The Body Farm: Good</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/06/24.html#the-body-farm:-good</link><description /><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801229</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">CAdpQeiqZ7Xqk_0moRMvimzWkK0LZlm5ofQr5zFAYzU=</guid></item><item><title>CSS only dark mode without JS</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/06/24.html#css-only-dark-mode-without-js</link><description>Last week I implemented dark mode on my website, without using any

time and space complexity of various operations. The concept of Big
O notation helps programmers understand how quickly or slowly an
algorithm will execute as the input size grows.
In this article, weâll cover the basics of Big O notation, why it is
used and how describe the time and space complexity of algorithms
with example.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801241</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">qGAsjOauSlKMKuQm2G4JRioqjGU3XkSc6flN3zhlyIk=</guid></item><item><title>Clearing up some misconceptions about Passkeys</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/06/24.html#clearing-up-some-misconceptions-about-passkeys</link><description>I am unreasonably excited about
passkeys, Iâve
long been looking
for a better/more convenient way than passwords to do
authentication, and I think passkeys are finally it.
However, whenever I see passkeys mentioned (for example on the
recent Tailscale post about
them), there are always a lot of misconceptions that surface in the
debate. Iâd like to clear some of them here, and hopefully explain a
bit better what passkeys are.</description><pubDate>2024-01-29 16:49:28.801253</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">ela3f9nZkdwTZBgV6rUOyk3aK7ix_DO1Fh3ToedpNjc=</guid></item><item><title>The Bubble (2022)</title><link>https://plurrrr.com/archive/2023/06/24.html#the-bubble-(2022)</link><description>A group of actors and actresses stuck inside a pandemic bubble at a
